# Mega
Alignment Viewer

Written in Python, Mega.py is a complement to the popular aligner <a href="http://www.megasoftware.net/">Mega</a>. While Mega has a plethora of other varying functions (Muscle and ClustalW alignment algorithms, phylogeny construction, calculating evolutionary rates, etc.), this script solely focuses on displaying DNA and protein alignments in an user friendly manner. The motivation to write this program was to manage DNA ambiguity characters when translating to amino acid residues, which Mega cannot handle. The convenience of this allows the user to effortlessly visualize the resulting protein sequence to make inferences on its overall function or go back and decipher the intended nitrogenous base.
